It is good practice---some would say, essential to doing Agile properly---to hold 
a "retrospective meeting" (or "retro" for short) at the end of each iteration (aka "sprint").


The purpose of a retro can be summed up as:
* identify what's going well and what's not going well
* figure out how to turn up the good, and turn down the bad

On the [Agile101 Guide](https://agilealliance.org/agile101) 
the "every sprint" retro is called the [heartbeat retros](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/heartbeatretro).
We'l consider these terms to mean the same thing:
* Sprint Retro
* Iteration Retro
* Heartbeat Retro

# Milestone Retro vs. Sprint Retro

The [Agile 101 Guide](https://agilealliance.org/agile101) also meantions a longer-form [milestone retro](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/milestone-retrospective/)
which is held less often---maybe once or twice a year, for example---which the team reaches a major milestone in their
product development.    Because of the short length of the 10-week quarter at UCSB, in the context of CS48, we might do a 
*milestone retro*, if at all,  at the end of the entire course, to reflect on the course as a whole.

# Retro Templates

A "retro template" is a high-level outline for structuring a retro.  Here are some popular templates:

* {% include link.md text='Start/Stop/Continue' href='/topics/retros_start_stop_continue/' %}: the team reflects on
     * what activites want to stop doing (because they aren't helpful)
     * what activities they want to start doing (because they think it will help)
     * what activities they should continue (because they are working well)

* {% include link.md text='Darby/Larsen 5-Step Retro' href='/topics/retros_darby_larsen/' %}: This retro template,
   introducted by 
   [Esther Derby](http://www.estherderby.com/) and 
   [Dianna Larsen](https://www.futureworksconsulting.com/about/diana-larsen)
   in the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](http://www.estherderby.com/books)
   has five steps:
   * Step 1: Set the Stage
   * Step 2: Gather Data
   * Step 3: Generating Insights
   * Step 4: Decide What To Do
   * Step 5: Close the Retro

# Exercises

In addition to the templates above, there are also many exercises that can be used:

* The website [Retro-mat](https://retromat.org/en/) contains over 100 activities in English (and six 
   other languages including 中文) that retro leaders can choose from. 

* Spotify (yes, that Spotify) has a [Spotify Retro Kit](https://labs.spotify.com/2017/12/15/spotify-retro-kit/) that they've put
   together to help their teams run successful retros.

Many more links are listed below.
   
# Choosing Exercises   

The facilitator of the retro has the responsibility for
choosing practices that they think will be effective for their team, taking into account factors
such as:
* the personalities of the team members
* the level of familiarity they have with the retro process
* the setting in which the retro is taking place
* the particular challenges facing the team

# Big Picture Values

It's helpful to choose practices that are fun and engaging, and to change up the practices so that 
folks don't get bored with the exercise.  However, even more important is to focus on these big picture 
values:

* Try to structure activities so that *everyone's* voices are heard
   * Help folks that are more vocal to keep their sharing short and make space
   * Help folks that are less vocal to feel comfortable speaking up
* It is helpful for the facilitator to focus on *facilitating* not *participating*
   * The facilitator may have their own opinions
   * While conducting the retro, they may like to set those aside
   * Instead, consider focusing ONLY on helping the other participants voices be heard.

# Guides for retrospective faciltators

I would not suggest that you read ALL of these articles before running your first retro---that could lead to information
overload.  

Instead, I suggest skimming through until you find ONE that resonates for you and gives you a sense that you
can take this on successfully.  Then go back and revisit the other articles later as you get more experience.
